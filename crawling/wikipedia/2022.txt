In the video game industry, 2021 saw the release of many new video games. The numerous delays in software and hardware releases due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacted development schedules, leading to many games being delayed into this year or indefinitely. Additionally, computer and console hardware were impacted by the combined effects of semiconductor shortage (partially from post-COVID-19 effects) and a rising growth of bitcoin mining that strained the supply of critical components.[1]
