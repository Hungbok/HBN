Ukraine support

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine launched in February that year, several video game developers and publishers with ties to Eastern Europe provided support for Ukrainian aid.[42] On February 24, 11 bit studios pledged to donate all profits earned over the following seven days from This War of Mine (2014) and its downloadable content to the Ukrainian Red Cross.[43] CD Projekt Red donated 1 million zloty (about €182,000) to the Polish Humanitarian Action group.[44] Embracer Group donated $1 million to Red Cross, SOS Children's Villages, and ACT Alliance, among other charities.[45] SCS Software donated over €20,000 to "multiple charities", and is working on new DLC for American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 to raise funds for Ukrainian charities.[46] The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced they would donate $200K each, alongside an addition $75K raised by Niantic employees, to organisations such as GlobalGiving to provide humanitarian relief in Ukraine.[47][48] In addition, Niantic announced the suspended availability of Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Ingress in both Russia and Belarus.[49][50]

Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Activision Blizzard, among others, halted sales of physical and digital products into Russia during the conflict.[51][52] Electronic Arts announced on March 2 that it had started the process to remove the Russia national football team and Russian football clubs from its FIFA series as well as removing the Belarusian and Russian national teams and their club teams from NHL 22.[53] In addition to preventing purchase of their games in Russia, Nintendo announced on March 9 that Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, a tactical war game with a faction based on Soviet-era Russia, would be indefinitely delayed due to "recent world events".[54][55][56]

Two game bundles offered by itch.io and Humble Bundle raised over $6 million and $20 million for Ukraine aid support, respectively.[57][58] Epic Games made all proceeds from Fortnite during the last two weeks of March 2022 go to charitable aid for Ukraine, and raised over $144 million.[59][60]

Abortion rights support
After the June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the protected right to abortion, several video game companies affirmed they would offer their employees abortion benefits, including the ability to travel to states with protected abortion rights if necessary. Such companies include Microsoft, Bethesda, Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, Daybreak Games, Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Electronic Arts, and Bungie.[61]
